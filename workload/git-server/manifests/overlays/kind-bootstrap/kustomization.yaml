  # remove all Ingresses
  # 
  # This is bootstrap so there is no load-balancer nor ingress controller.
  # So there is no point in having Ingress, since there is no one to assign
  # it an external IP address. Moreover, it would cause GitOps tools to keep
  # the Git server Application in intermediate state, because it would try
  # to wait for the Ingress to get initialized with that external IP address.
  #
  # The Git server accessible from inside the cluster is necessary however.
  # It is the source of all deployment files used by the GitOps tools
  # for bootstraping and subsequently managing the cluster.
  # It would be possible to just use an external Git server such as GitHub,
  # but the goal of this demonstration is to provide self-contained solution.
